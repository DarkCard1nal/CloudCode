Feature: Cloud Code Server
	As a cloud computing system
	I want to ensure the server works correctly
	So that it can process client requests properly

	Background:
		Given the server is running

	Scenario: Server starts successfully
		When I start the server
		Then the server should be running
		And it should be listening on the configured port

	Scenario: Server processes task
		Given a valid task file is sent
		When the server receives the task
		Then it should process the task
		And return the execution results
		And the task status should be "completed"

	Scenario: Server handles invalid task
		Given an invalid task file is sent
		When the server receives the task
		Then it should return an error message
		And the task status should be "failed"
		
	Scenario: Server handles corrupted file
		Given a corrupted file is sent
		When the server receives the file
		Then it should validate the file format
		And return a proper error message
		
	Scenario: Server handles multiple simultaneous requests
		Given multiple clients are connected
		When "20" tasks are submitted simultaneously
		Then the server should process all tasks
		And maintain reasonable response times
		And not crash or hang
		
	Scenario: Server performance under load
		Given the server is under heavy load
		When new tasks arrive
		Then the server should queue tasks appropriately
		And process them in order of priority
		
	Scenario: Server handles task timeout
		Given a task that runs indefinitely
		When the server executes the task
		Then it should terminate the task after timeout limit
		And return a timeout error
		And free all allocated resources
		
	Scenario: Server handles malicious requests
		Given a malformed request is sent
		When the server processes the request
		Then it should reject the invalid request
		And not expose sensitive information in error messages
